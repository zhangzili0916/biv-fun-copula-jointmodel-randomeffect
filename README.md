R code for "A bivariate functional copula joint model for longitudinal measurements and time-to-event dataâ€œ This repository includes R code for the simulation study and real data analysis. All the studies were based on RStudio of version 1.3.1073. The file "simulationstudy.R" includes the R codes to perform the simulation study. Function "Y.bivcopjoineR.rho.BS.unb" generate joint data of longitudinal measurements and survival times via the bivariate Ganssian and t copula. Function "EstY.bivcop.funrhoty.nlm" perform the estimation process. The log-likelihhood functions "appGQbivGaucoploglik.funrhoty", "appGQbivGaucoploglik.0rhoty" and "appGQbivtcoploglik.funrhoty" are required in the estimation process.
